<h5><u>Our Solar System</u></h5>

<P>We have 8 full sized planets and 5 others that are classed as dwarf planets. There are many acronyms to help in remembering the order of the planets but this is the one that I use.</P>
<p><u>M</u>ary's = Mercury</p> <p><u>V</u>irgin = Venus</p><p><u>E</u>xplanation = Earth</p> <p><u>M</u>eans = Mars</p> <p><u>J</u>oseph = Jupiter</p> <p><u>S</u>uspects = Saturn</p> <p><u>U</u>pstairs = Uranus</p> <p><u>N</u>eighbour = Neptune</P>


<p>If you want an acronym that includes the dwarf planets then it could be “My Very Educated Mother Could Just Serve Us Noodles, Pie, Ham, Muffins, and Eggs” but we will come to the dwarf planets later.</p>

<h6><u>Requirements for Planet status</u></h6>

<p>For a body to be considered a planet, then it must meet 3 criteria.</p>
<p>1 - It must be large enough that it's gravity pulls it into a sphere</p>
<p>2 - It must orbit the Sun</p>
<p>3 - It must clear its own orbit of debris</p>

<h8><u>Now onto dwarf planets inside our Solar System</u></h8>

<p>Let's have another look at the acronym from before which includes the dwark planets. <br><br>

    “My Very Educated Mother Could Just Serve Us Noodles, Pie, Ham, Muffins, and Eggs” <br><br>

So we have the main 8 planets and an additional 5 dwarf planets in this. These 5 in order are Ceres, Pluto, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris.<br><br>
Ceres is in the asteroid belt which is between Mars and Jupiter. Pluto is just beyond Uranus and then the other 3 are in the Kuiper Belt which is a belt of icey objects on the edge of our Solar System orbiting the Sun.</p>
